Generative design in the design development of metallic constructions


### About

Repository of documents, experiments, codes and thesis carried out during the Master's Degree in Metallic Construction of the Department of Civil Engineering of the School of Mines of the Federal University of Ouro Preto, Brazil, as an integral part of the requirements to obtain the title of Master in Construction Metallic.

### Strategy

1. construction of the design space;

2. development of measures to assess structural and environmental performance;

3. the application of evolutionary algorithms to search the design space and find high performance projects.
